        <h1>CNRL Tar Sand Spill Counter</h1>
        <p>Right now there are 4 on-going, uncontrollable tar sands spills that have been spilling into the environment near Cold Lake, Alberta for months and CNRL (Canadian National Resources Ltd.) and the Alberta and Canadian government are unable to stop them. The uncappable spills are just going to keep spilling.</p>
        <p>The spill counter shows how much has been spilled and continues to spill into the environment and traditional territory of the Beaver Lake Cree and Cold Lake First Nations.</p>
